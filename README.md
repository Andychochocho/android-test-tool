Android Test Tool is a lightweight user-friendly desktop app for Android testing.

**NOTE**: In order to be able to use this tool, you first need ADB installed. We recommend this method on MacOS:

Open terminal and install home-brew and adb with the following commands (if not done so already):
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

brew cask install android-platform-tools
```

Make sure that the path of your platform tools is  /Users/USERNAME/.android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools
